In the quiet of the moonlit glen,
Where time unravels, born again,
Your voice is like a fleeting breeze,
A whisper caught among the trees.

In every glance, a thousand words,
A language only hearts have heard.
The universe in your soft sigh,
A star-lit trail across the sky.

Your touch, a symphony of light,
A quiet pulse in the darkest night,
Each fingertip a world unspoken,
Each heartbeat bound by loveâ€™s token.

Through every storm, through skies that break,
My soul has flown, for your love's sake.
A tethered dream, yet boundless, free,
In you, I find eternity.
